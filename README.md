## 👾 Description 

**Welcome to Blow up this balloon!**

In this repository we present you a **simple, intuitive website adapted to any kind of device** (mobile, tablet and PC) so you can take a look at it at any time. **Designed and developed with HTML, CSS and JS**, with just a few clicks you can blow up a balloon until it explodes. 

### How to play

- Click on the balloon to make it grow in size (and colour). Will grow by 10 px per click.
- To take it back to its previous state, just remove the cursor from the balloon. Will decrease by 5px and return to the previous colour.
- When the balloon reaches 420px... it will explode!
- To restart the game simply click on the text.

⚠️ **Caution**: it is advisable not to hit it too quickly so that the colour changes do not damage the eyes.

## 📝 Requirements

The exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following **elements**:

- **JS**

The following **requirements** have to be respected:

1. Create in HTML/CSS a **balloon 200px by 200px** with a **red** background colour.
2. **When** the balloon is **clicked**, its **size will grow by 10px**, keeping its round shape. **With each click**, its **colour will change** in the following order: from **red to green, then blue and back to red**.
3. If its **size is bigger than 420px** it will **explode** and return to its round shape.
4. Additional small detail, when the **mouse is on the balloon and leaves it**, the **size** of the balloon is **reduced by 5px**(the size of the balloon can't be less than 200px), and its **colour will changes in the reverse order** as mentioned above.
